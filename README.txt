there is an endless pit inside of my home, a cold breese emerges from it at 5 pm every day. It pleeds for me a sacrifice every day. I'm horrified of what it would do if I forget to feed it, but the attrocities I've commited in it's name stack up higher each and every day. IM NO LONGER HUMAN BUT A BARBARIC BEAST GIVING THIS  PIT ITS DINNER. IM A SLAVE TO THE HOLE. I'VE LOST ALL SENSES. I'M THE HOLE.

The hole was never a metophor.
